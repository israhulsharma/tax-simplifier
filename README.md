a program which calculates the correct amount of tax for a gift from a close relative

According to the Finnish Tax Administration, a gift is a transfer of property to another person against no compensation or payment. If the total value of the gifts you receive from the same donor in the course of 3 years is â‚¬5,000 or more, you must pay gift tax.

When the gift is received from a close relative or a family member, the amount of tax to be paid is determined by the following table, which is also available on this website:

So, for a gift of 6 000 euros the recipient pays a tax of 180 euros (100 + (6 000 - 5 000) * 0.08). Similarly, for a gift of 75 000 euros the recipient pays a tax of 7 100 euros (4 700 + (75 000 - 55 000) * 0.12).

Please write a program which calculates the correct amount of tax for a gift from a close relative. Have a look at the examples below to see what is expected. Notice the lack of thousands separators in the input values - you may assume there will be no spaces or other thousands separators in the numbers in the input, as we haven't yet covered dealing with these.
